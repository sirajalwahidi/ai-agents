"""
routes.py — defines the URL paths (routes) that the web app responds to.

A ROUTE maps a URL to a Python function. When a browser visits a URL,
Flask calls the matching function and sends back its return value as HTML.

Example:
  Browser visits http://localhost:8080/resume
      → Flask calls the resume() function below
      → resume() queries the database and renders resume.html
      → The browser receives and displays the HTML page

The @app.route('/path') decorator is what connects a URL to a function.
You learned about decorators in your OOP course — they wrap a function
with extra behavior. Here, the decorator registers the function with Flask.

NOTE: Chat messages do NOT go through a route. They travel over a
      WebSocket connection handled in flask_app/utils/socket_events.py.
      Read that file after this one to see how the chat works.

    to load all institutions, positions,
    experiences, and skills. The result is a nested dictionary that
    we pass to the template as the variable 'resume'.

    In resume.html, Jinja2 loops over this dictionary to render the page.
    The chat panel is also part of resume.html — students can ask the AI
    questions about what they're reading.
